# Mapping_Earthquakes
## This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

- **Deliverable 1:** Add Tectonic Plate Data
- - Using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
- **Deliverable 2:** Add Major Earthquake Data
- - Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). Also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().
- **Deliverable 3:** Add an Additional Map
- - Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to the earthquake map.
